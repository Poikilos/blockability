# Blockability
A Pygame block engine with linear exploration (a work in progress).

## Known issues
* jumping downward into door can cause falling back out but warping to next room, causing you to fall through bottom of world
	
## Changes since platformy
(all changes since initial commit that had 1-color blocks, exit on door, 1-frame non-alpha sprite)

## Credits
* based on LiefAndersen's platformy
* turtle supplied by LiefAndersen (I could not find any source via google similar image search)
* All the square graphic tiles used in this program from the file DungeonCrawl_ProjectUtumnoTileset.png (CC-0) is the Public domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles". Some of the tiles have been modified by expertmm.
